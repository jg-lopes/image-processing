# image-processing

This repository presents the code for the Image Processing class on the 2A (Fourth Year) of CentraleSup√©lec. 

It consists of a classical approach on image classification, where key region properties and the image's Fourier Features are fed into a simple ML classification algorithm (kmeans).

These techniques exist in comparison to the more popular Neural Network techniques that define the state of the art in image classification today. While it is a simpler approach with worse results in complex images, the simplicity of the method allows for greater efficiency and interpretability when working with a simpler dataset.
